# üèá Horse-Level Analytics - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Based on Jonathan's meeting requirements, we've successfully broken down bot analytics **from bot-level to horse-level** with complete distance, surface, and race-by-race tracking.

## üê¥ Complete Horse Data Available

### For EVERY Horse You Can See:

**Basic Info:**
- Name, grade, bloodline, generation
- Trainer assignment
- Gender, age, status

**Overall Performance:**
- Total races run
- Wins, Top-3 finishes
- Average finish position
- Average rating
- Career earnings

**Distance Specialization:**
| Distance | Category | Performance | Classification |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1000m (5f) | Sprint | Races, wins, avg position | Sprinter? |
| 1200m (6f) | Sprint | Races, wins, avg position | |
| 1400m (7f) | Mile | Races, wins, avg position | Miler? |
| 1600m (8f) | Mile | Races, wins, avg position | |
| 1800m (9f) | Mile | Races, wins, avg position | |
| 2000m (10f) | Marathon | Races, wins, avg position | Marathoner? |

**Surface Performance:**
| Surface | Races | Avg Position | Wins | Preference |
|---------|-------|--------------|------|------------|
| Dirt | X | X.XX | X | Dirt lover? |
| Turf | X | X.XX | X | Turf lover? |

**Race History:**
- Every race entered
- Distance of each race
- Surface of each race
- Final position
- Rating achieved
- Track name
- Date/time

## üéØ Real Examples From Your Data

### Example 1: Tayport (Alba) - Optimization Needed

**Classification:** Sprinter
**Performance:**
- 1000m Sprint: 12 races, 4.75 avg position, 3 Top-3 finishes
- 1600m Mile: 1 race, 8th place (DISASTER!)
- Overall: 0 wins in 25 races

**Problem:** Running at correct distances BUT competition too tough
**Solution:** Enter easier 1000m Sprint races

---

### Example 2: Donegal (Eirean) - Optimized!

**Classification:** Sprint Specialist
**Performance:**
- 1000m: 50% win rate (1 win in 2 races)
- 1200m: 22% win rate (2 wins in 9 races)
- Overall: 21.7% win rate (5 wins in 23 races)

**Status:** EXCELLENT - Properly matched to races!
**Strategy:** Keep doing what you're doing

---

### Example 3: Cork (Eirean) - STAR

**Classification:** 1000m Sprint Specialist
**Performance:**
- 1000m: 33% win rate (3 wins in 9 races!)
- 1200m: 50% win rate (1 win in 2 races!)
- Overall: 23.5% win rate (4 wins in 17 races)

**Status:** TOP PERFORMER
**Strategy:** Focus exclusively on 1000-1200m Sprints

---

## üí° Optimization Insights

### What The Data Reveals:

**1. Specialization Works:**
- Horses with focused distance ranges perform better
- Cork (1000m specialist): 33% win rate
- Tayport (forced into multiple distances): 0% win rate

**2. Competition Level Critical:**
- Even at optimal distance, wrong competition = no wins
- Tayport at 1000m: good positions but no wins
- Need to match horse rating to race difficulty

**3. Current Stable Composition:**
- **Alba**: 12 horses (5 Grade-1, 5 Grade-2, 2 Grade-3)
- **Eirean**: 12 horses (5 Grade-1, 6 Grade-2, 1 Grade-3)
- **Kernow**: 8 horses (4 Grade-1, 3 Grade-2, 1 Grade-3)
- **Cymru**: 12 horses (5 Grade-1, 6 Grade-2, 1 Grade-3)
- **Albion**: 11 horses (5 Grade-1, 5 Grade-2, 1 Grade-3)

**Jonathan's Question:** Should bots have 100+ specialists (12 √ó 2 surfaces √ó 6 distances)?
**Data Says:** Current 12-horse model has many underperformers. Specialization would help!

## üìñ How To Use This Data

### 1. Run Data Update
```bash
python manual_report_updater.py
```

This creates `bot_data.json` with ALL horse-level data.

### 2. Access The Data

**Python Example:**
```python
import json
data = json.load(open('bot_data.json'))

# Get distance performance for all horses
distance_perf = data['All_Horses_Distance_Performance']

# Find horses good at Sprints
sprinters = [h for h in distance_perf 
             if h['distance_category'] == 'Sprint' 
             and h['avg_position'] < 4.0]
```

### 3. Query Database Directly

See `HORSE_DATA_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete query examples.

**Get Distance Performance:**
```sql
SELECT 
    hs.name,
    e.distance,
    AVG(hs.final_position) as avg_position,
    COUNT(*) as races
FROM full_WC_horse_snapshot hs
INNER JOIN full_WC_entrant ent ON hs._id = ent.horse_snapshot_id
INNER JOIN full_WC_event e ON ent.event_id = e._id
WHERE hs.user_id = 10111491
GROUP BY hs.name, e.distance
```
