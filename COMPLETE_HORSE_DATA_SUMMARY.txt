COMPLETE HORSE-LEVEL DATA CAPTURED - ALL BOTS
================================================================================

DATA SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURED:
  - 273 distance performance records (every horse x distance combination)
  - 247 surface performance records (every horse x surface x condition)
  - 861 complete race records with full details
  - 54 horses tracked across 5 bots
  - Distance specialization identified
  - Surface preferences calculated

DOCUMENTATION CREATED
================================================================================

File: HORSE_DATA_DOCUMENTATION.md

Contents:
  1. Database schema mapping
  2. How to find horse performance data
  3. Distance data location (entrant -> event tables)
  4. Surface data location (dirt vs turf)
  5. Table relationships and JOIN keys
  6. Query examples for optimization

Key Discovery:
  - Horse snapshots link to entrants via horse_snapshot_id
  - Entrants link to events via event_id
  - Events contain distance, surface, weather, condition!

EXAMPLE FINDINGS - TAYPORT (Alba's Horse)
================================================================================

Horse Type: SPRINTER (not Miler as initially thought!)

Distance Performance:
  - 1000m (5f Sprint): 12 races, 4.75 avg position, 0 wins, 3 Top-3
  - 1200m (6f Sprint):  2 races, 5.50 avg position, 0 wins
  - 1400m (7f Mile):    1 race,  4.00 avg position
  - 1600m (8f Mile):    1 race,  8.00 avg position (WORST!)
  - 1800m (9f Mile):    3 races, 5.00 avg position

By Category:
  - Sprint: 14 races (74%), 4.86 avg position
  - Mile:    5 races (26%), 5.40 avg position (WORSE)

Surface Performance:
  - Dirt: 11 races, 5.09 avg position
  - Unknown: 8 races, 4.88 avg position

Conclusion:
  - SPECIALIZATION: Sprinter (best at 1000m)
  - PROBLEM: 0 wins despite being in right distance type
  - ISSUE: Competition level too high
  - FIX: Enter easier Sprint races

EXAMPLE FINDINGS - DONEGAL (Eirean's Star Performer)
================================================================================

Horse Type: SPRINTER - EXCELLENT PERFORMER

Distance Performance:
  - 1000m (5f): 2 races, 2.50 avg, 1 win (50% win rate!)
  - 1200m (6f): 9 races, 3.56 avg, 2 wins (22% win rate!)
  - 1400m (7f): 7 races, 4.00 avg, 0 wins
  - 1600m (8f): 5 races, 4.40 avg, 2 wins (40% win rate!)

Total: 23 races, 5 wins (21.7% win rate)

Specialization: Sprint (11 races, 3.03 avg position)

Analysis:
  - EXCELS at Sprints - 3/11 wins (27%)
  - Also good at 1600m Mile (40% win rate!)
  - Should focus on 1000-1600m range
  - THIS IS HOW TO OPTIMIZE: Right horse, right distance!

KEY INSIGHTS FROM DATA
================================================================================

1. DISTANCE SPECIALIZATION EXISTS:
   - Some horses are Sprinters (1000-1200m)
   - Some horses are Milers (1400-1800m)
   - Few Marathon specialists (2000m)

2. SURFACE PREFERENCES VARY:
   - Most horses have data for Dirt vs Unknown/Turf
   - Performance differences can be 1-2 positions

3. MISMATCHES IDENTIFIED:
   - Low-performing horses often at wrong distances
   - High-performing horses matched to optimal distances
   - Competition level still main factor (win rate low overall)

4. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Match horse stats to optimal distances
   - Avoid forcing Sprinters into Mile/Marathon races
   - Focus high-stamina horses on longer distances
   - Lower competition levels for struggling horses

DATA NOW READY FOR:
================================================================================

1. Jonathan's Optimization Model
   - Multivariate analysis
   - Horse-level performance factors
   - Race selection optimization
   - Stable composition analysis

2. Specific Optimization Questions:
   - Which horses should race at which distances?
   - Should bots specialize more (100+ horses)?
   - Which surface/conditions favor which horses?
   - Optimal grade selection per horse?

3. Break-Even Strategy:
   - Identify highest-performing horses
   - Allocate more races to winners
   - Bench/retrain underperformers
   - Match competition level to horse capability

================================================================================
